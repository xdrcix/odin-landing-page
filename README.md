# odin-landing-page

Thoughts about this project:

I initially came to this project with a lot of confidence as I felt I had a strong understanding of the previous concepts covered. We've aleady covered structuring a page and I made sure to get plently of practice with css through some of the addtional activites. It's just this time I needed to combine the two together. Turns out there is a little more to it than just that.

This project allowed me to discover some shortcomings that I would like to tidy up on as a continue through the course.

- Identifying re-usable elements and layering them in one encompasing class.
- Cleaning up the stylesheet by grouping decorative elements such as fonts and colors to specific groups.

Some accomplishments that im proud of.
- Familiarizing myself with muiltiple shortcuts in VsCode
    Emmet: Wrapper to speed up coding | Commenting / tabing  multi lines
- Quicky identifying a flex box grid to get components to the right spots.
- Using Google-Dev tools to spot hidden margins. Im looking at YOU <p>
